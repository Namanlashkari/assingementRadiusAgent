Problem & Assumption :
   
    This file contains the problem statement and the list of assumptions I have made while preparing the solution
 
 
SolutionOverview : 
    
    This file discusss the possbile solution approaches and future extendsion to solution. It is a subject to discussion and I
    tried my best to give a brief overview of what I thought could lead to better results and am open to comments on the same.
  
  
Suggestions :
       
      This file contains all the list of possible suggestion and opions based on my research to better scale the system and 
      optimise it to be more ready to deloy solution.
      Again this is open to discussion and is based on my understnading of the system and solution.
      
      
Solution1:

    This contains the first solution, it requires you to setup your flask server for handling the rest API's.
    Also it requires you to have python3, MYSQL for local database hosting on your machine.   
    The command and links for the same are attached below.
    
    The solution is an unsuccessful attempt at creating a fully functional service which retrieves data from the data in an 
    optimal search and perform operations on the same via calculating weights according to the provided criteria and produce 
    solution using RESTAPI structure.
    
    The plan was to get result using flask api calls on a webui or and sorted list of response via POSTMAN.
    
    
Solution2:
   
    This contains the second solution and brief discussion on implenting and working with quadtrees and how indexing can help 
    better the solution and retrival of data.
    
    An extended discussion will be comparing the cost of write operation vs the read operations making a call based on it.
    

 Solution3:
    
      This contains the third solution and brief discussion on the same solution appproach.
